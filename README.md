Magic angle bilayer graphene was shown to be superconducting in 2018 [[1](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature26160)]. 
Despite the considerable hype concerning this discovery, little code exists to visualize the moiré pattern of two graphene layers.

To illustrate the work as done in our own paper ["Direct evidence for flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene from nano-ARPES"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02289), I created this repository.
This repository contains a simple Python notebook to interactively generate visualizations of moire patterns of hexagonal lattices at different angles.

Click the "Launch binder" button above to open an interactive notebook directly in your browser. (Note: performance in the mybinder environment is rather slow. This seems to be a bug and is a work in progress. Download and run the notebook on a local machine for better performance.)
